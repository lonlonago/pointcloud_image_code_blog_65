##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###   1. Overview of the principle 

  The Ball Rotation Algorithm (BPA) is a method of surface reconstruction related to alpha-shapes. Intuitively, imagine a three-dimensional sphere with a given radius and we place it on a point cloud. If it hits any 3 points (and it doesn't fall out of those 3 points), it creates a triangle. The algorithm then starts rotating from the edge of the existing triangle, creating another triangle every time it reaches 3 points and the ball doesn't fall out.

  Implemented the ball rotation algorithm proposed by F. Bernardini et al. (F. Bernardini et al., "The ball-pivoting algorithm for surface reconstruction", 1999. "). The implementation is also based on the algorithm outlined in Digne 2014 in" An Analysis and Implementation of a Parallel Ball Pivoting Algorithm ", 2014." Surface reconstruction is done by rolling a ball of a given radius on a point cloud, creating a triangle every time the ball touches three points.
