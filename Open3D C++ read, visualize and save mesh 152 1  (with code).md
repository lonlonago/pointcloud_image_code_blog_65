 ```  
  The function call reads the mesh based on the filename extension. 

  Compared to point cloud data structures, meshes have triangles that define a three-dimensional surface. By default, Open3D attempts to infer the file type by filename extension. The following mesh file types are supported:

 ```  
###  2. Save the mesh 

WriteTriangleMesh() 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574588834
 ```  
  Save the mesh to a local folder. The function calls the write function based on the extension filename. If the write function supports binary encoding and compression, the latter two arguments will be used. Otherwise they will be ignored. Currently, only the .obj format supports uv coordinates (triangle_uvs) and textures.
