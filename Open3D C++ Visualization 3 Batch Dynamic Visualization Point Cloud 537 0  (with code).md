   When I get a new point cloud dataset, I want to quickly see the shape characteristics of the point clouds in the dataset. However, for a dataset with thousands of point clouds, dragging the point clouds into the software to view them one by one is obviously extremely inefficient. Therefore, the code implements the file path and file format of a given point cloud dataset, and automatically visualizes each point cloud in a folder dynamically in batches.
